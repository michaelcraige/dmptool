  # Note that we use the AnywayConfig gem to manage our configuration variables. AnywayConfig loads
  # your config in a cascading manner similar to the way CSS works. The load order is:
  #   - dmproadmap.yml (this file)
  #   - secrets.yml
  #   - credentials.yml.enc
  #   - ENV variables (from either the .env file or ENV variables)
  #
  # If a variable is defined in the dmproadmap.yml and also in the credentials.yml.enc, the value
  # in the credentials file will be used.
  #
  # For more info about AnywayConfig, see: https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config
  #
  # Blank entries in this file are by design. AnywayConfig allows us to specify required config
  # variables. If for example database_password is not found in one of the locations mentioned above,
  # then the application will fail to startup.
  # For example:
  #  "Anyway::Config::ValidationError: The following config parameters are missing or empty: database_password
  #
  # We have added a lib/tasks/utils/config.rake task file which can be used to help debug any config
  # issues. For example you can run `rails config:trace` which will return something like this (note:
  # ':secrets' is the Rails credentials file, :env is either an ENV of .env variable):
  #
  #  "Loading DmproadmapConfig:"
  # "---------------------------------------------------"
  #
  # {"database_password"=>
  #   {:value=> "blah...blah...blah",
  #    :source=>{:type=>:credentials, :store=>"config/credentials.yml.enc"}},
  #  "server_host"=>
  #   {:value=>"https://foo.bar",
  #    :source=>{:type=>:env, :key=>"DMPROADMAP_SERVER_HOST"}},
  #  "port"=>
  #    {:value=>"3000", :source=>{:type=>:yml, :path=>"config/dmproadmap.yml"}}}
  #
  # In Summary:
  #   If an entry here is blank then you MUST define it in the credentials.yml.enc (preferred) or in an
  #   SSM variable (as `/uc3/dmp/tool/[env]/dmproadmap/[variable_name]`)
  #
  #   If you would like to override one of the other values in this file then you should define it as
  #   an SSM variable (as `/uc3/dmp/tool/[env]/dmproadmap/[variable_name]`)
